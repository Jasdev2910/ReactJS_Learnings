# React & React DOM

**React:**

*Purpose:* 

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a way to define and manage UI components, manage state and props, and handle the rendering of components.

*Components:* 

React allows you to define components using either JavaScript classes or functional components. Components are reusable building blocks that encapsulate a piece of UI and its behavior.

*Virtual DOM:* 

React introduces a virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. It efficiently updates and renders changes to the UI by comparing the virtual DOM with the real DOM and applying only the necessary updates.

*JSX:* 

React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax to define components. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making it easier to visualize and create UI structures.

**ReactDOM:**

*Purpose:* 

ReactDOM is a package that provides methods specifically for interacting with the actual DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page.

*Rendering:*

The main function of ReactDOM is to render React components into the actual DOM. It bridges the gap between the virtual DOM managed by React and the real DOM in the browser.

*ReactDOM.render():*

 This function is used to render a React element or component into a DOM node. It's the entry point of your application where you start rendering your React tree.
